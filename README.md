#### Wander, now for IOS. 
###### demo currently unavailable on the web, check out the screenshots <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/CarrieStreed/wander-for-ios" target="_blank">here</a>.

### App overview:

After building Wander in project-two for the web (https://github.com/carriestreed/project-two), I wanted to challenge myself with building the app specifically for a mobile device using React Native and user Authentication. 

##### Technologies used:
- React Native
- ES6
- JavaScript
- JSX
- Ruby on Rails, Devise for user Authentication
- Flickr API


### Known bugs:

- Still need to create error handling for incorrect logins, countries not found, etc
- 'Home' tab isn't really useful since the tabbar preserves state

### Future features:

- Add ability for users to save photos into their own photo collection
- Create a 'photo collection' tab 
- Add ability for users to leave comments
- Autofill countries while typing in input box
